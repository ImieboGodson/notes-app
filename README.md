<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview



This project is a result of experimental thoughts of what the idea notes app should feel and function like. It will continue to evolve and take different shapes and style, as I continue to redefine what the idea notes app is to me. The goal is to create a notes application I am continuously happy to use and maintain.
